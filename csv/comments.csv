"Sad to see someone like Apple so dominant. They do very little of Merritt. Their OSes is *nix with a custom front end, they profit from reselling other peoples music, their computers are pcs, they rip people off left right and centre (literally, I don&#39;t mean theyre overpriced (which they are as well), they actually have policies that state to lie customers and sell them something else instead of repair), their products aren&#39;t what they claim (their &quot;unishell&quot; cases aren&#39;t actually a single piece, but rather 2 pieces GLUED TOGETHER, and in bad places so the glue softens with the heat that is directly blown onto it,.... I&#39;ve had machines literally fall apart in my hands), newer models of machines can be slower than the ones they replace due to terrible circulation, meaning they get so hot that the hardware throttles back to slower speeds, and so on and so forth. <br>And no, I don&#39;t say this as some sort of Anti Apple, just for the sake of it person,.... I actually had no idea about this stuff until I started repairing Apple gear,.... heck even had a customer get a quote from me after he was quoted $1100 from Apple, saying GPU was blown and the board needed to be replaced. <br>Cost me $9 to repair and the machine actually had NO discreet GPU either. <br>The ONLY things they do well are ARM CPUs and marketing. Most of their income is generated by being conmen.",0

"I don&#39;t really get this. I mean Apple  isn&#39;t really the best producer right now. They&#39;ve had their share of affairs and  bad decisions. Plus their phones aren&#39;t really a revolution right now. Other producers experiment more than them. And they don&#39;t have the best cameras(just look at comparisons), battery or memory. They aren&#39;t the fastest even. Also while their security is better than Android, it isn&#39;t foolproof as proved by latest news. Also the price is not reasonable at all (as the cost of producing these phones is like 40 percent of the price). In my personal opinion there aren&#39;t even the most beautiful phones out there. So why? What is so special about them?",0

Just goes to show you how popularity goes a long way. Credit to Apple for their marketing. I dont hate Apple products but do notice that a lot of people tend to buy the newest phone regardless if its actually gonna be more useful from their year old phone they have now. Apple definitely took advantage of the consumer need to have new shiny toys to play with. Cant fault em for it. At this point it sometimes feels like a sheep mentality but I also know people think Apple is easier to navigate and that definitely could be why they destroyed the competition or it could be a little bit of both.,1

Apple is still a shit company that screws over all their consumers when it comes to repairing their products.

Sure their stuff is trendy as shit and people are even willing to spend 1000$ on a T-shirt because of the brand but still, why would you get more expensive and worse products (Smartphones aren&#39;t only Apple tho, so many Smartphones are just pointless and too expensive). You only have pre build Desktop Computers with IOS, you could just build yourself a Computer or let it build for you(still cheaper) and throw Windows 10 on it or if you don&#39;t need the computer for specific programms (or gaming) you could just put a Linux OS on it, it&#39;s free and it provides you with pretty much everything you need. I can kinda see why people buy mac books but also there, you can buy the same hardware for a lower price. The only 2 reasons I see to buy an IOS device is because you&#39;re either too lazy to look into other devices or because you&#39;re used to some designing or music software and don&#39;t want to switch to something else.",0

"Controversial opinion here, Apple has no right to be here, they have absolutely massive profit margins on products because they can, Google has massive server rooms and they also make products like the pixel phones etc, apple is the only tech company that doesn&#39;t require a lot of software Devs / Servers, apples main source of income is the iPhones and Macs, iOS and macOS only exist for the devices, they don&#39;t make money selling iOS, Google requires servers for you know, Google search and YouTube, etc, Microsoft&#39;s primary income is windows licenses and they need Devs for Windows the same as Apple needs for macOS but apple doesn&#39;t sell macOS on it&#39;s own (mostly) and instead sell it with the Macs, just my opinion though, I&#39;m sure somebody could come up with a good reason why Apple doesn&#39;t deserve to be here but there is no defending their profit margins, they&#39;re INSANE.",1

"Baffles me why apple is still on top.  Since their iphone debut in 2007 they&#39;ve been about as innovative and cutting edge as day old toast.  Inferior computer specs for twice the price.  Smartphone capabilities no better than almost any competitor.  I just don&#39;t get why they&#39;re still as relevant as they are.  I&#39;m not saying their products are shit.  They&#39;re just priced about $500 more than they should be computer-wise and about $200 overpriced for their phones.  Don&#39;t get me started on their accessories.  A fucking mediocre at best wireless keyboard from them is quickly becoming the same price as the cheapest laptop/notebook PC available.  I&#39;m floored amazon isn&#39;t in the poll position.  It would make more sense if amazon was #1, Microsoft takes the 3rd spot, and apple slides down to the 4th position. <br><br>And how the hell does coke stay relevant too?  They literally do beverages, mainly sodas.  Crazy.  Also didn&#39;t realize mercedez was so prominent.  I mean it&#39;s a fairly popular car... I&#39;d say more notable, not popular.  It&#39;s not like you see a mercedez on every street corner, but.... top 15?  Really?  Would&#39;ve thought Honda would be on there instead.  Not only is it a popular car manufacturer but they make pretty much anything that has a motor.  Lawn mowers and snow blowers to airplanes and boats.",0

Building plants abroad, trying too hard to appeal to the global market made them lose the domestic market to Toyota, and honda. lower manufacturing prices reaulted in lower quality, but the prices were still inflating. etc. They&#39;re still heading south on the list. Maybe it&#39;ll turn around. Was a great company at one time.",0
